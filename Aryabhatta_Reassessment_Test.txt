Challenge:1
Write a Java program to analyze cryptocurrency market data. The data consists of daily prices for multiple cryptocurrencies over a period of days. Each cryptocurrency's prices are represented as an array of integers, where each element represents the price on a particular day. Your program should take input for the number of cryptocurrencies and their prices for each day.
Input Format:
Enter the number of cryptocurrencies: 3
Enter the number of days: 5
Give price details of cryptocurrency 1: 50 60 45 70 55
Give price details of cryptocurrency 2: 30 40 35 45 50
Give price details of cryptocurrency 3: 80 90 85 100 95
Output:
Average price for cryptocurrency 1: 56
Average price for cryptocurrency 2: 40
Average price for cryptocurrency 3: 90

Highest price of cryptocurrency 1: 70 (Day 4)
Lowest price of cryptocurrency 1: 45 (Day 3)

Highest price of cryptocurrency 2: 50 (Day 5)
Lowest price of cryptocurrency 2: 30 (Day 1)

Highest price of cryptocurrency 3: 100 (Day 4)
Lowest price of cryptocurrency 3: 80 (Day 1)

Day 1 highest price: 80
Day 2 highest price: 90
Day 3 highest price: 85
Day 4 highest price: 100
Day 5 highest price: 95

Challenge:2
Write a java code on a banking system that allows customers to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check their balance, and view their account information. 
As a software developer, your task is to create a program that can perform these operations using object-oriented programming concepts.
Task: Write a Java program that implements a Bank class and an Account class. The Bank class should contain methods for creating new accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, and checking daily withdrawal limits. 
The Account class should store information about individual customer accounts, such as the account number, account holder name, and current balance.
Instructions:
Create an Account class with the following instance variables:
1. accountNumber (String)
2. accountHolderName (String)
3. balance (double)
Create a Bank class that contains an Object Array of Account objects, which will be used to store the account information.
Add a method called createAccount() to the Bank class that takes the account holder name and initial balance as parameters and creates a new Account object with a unique account number.
Add a method called deposit() to the Account class that takes an amount parameter and adds it to the account balance.
Add a method called withdraw() to the Account class that takes an amount parameter and subtracts it from the account balance. The method should also check if the withdrawal amount exceeds the daily withdrawal limit, 
which should be set to a default value of $500.

Add a method called checkBalance() to the Account class that returns the current balance of the account.
Add a method called displayInfo() to the Account class that displays the account number, account holder name, and current balance of the account.
In the main method of the program, prompt the user to select an operation:
1 to create a new account
2 to deposit money
3 to withdraw money
4 to check the balance
5 to display account information
6 to exit the program
Based on the user's selection, call the appropriate method in the Bank or Account class.
Repeat steps 6 until the user chooses to exit the program.
Example Output:
Welcome to the Bank Management System!
Please select an operation:
Create an account
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Check the balance
Display account information
Exit the program
Enter your choice: 1
Enter account holder name: John Doe
Enter initial balance: 1000
Account created successfully!
Account number: 1001
Account holder name: John Doe
Current balance: 1000.0
Please select an operation:

Create an account
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Check the balance
Display account information
Exit the program
Enter your choice: 2
Enter account number: 1001
Enter amount to deposit: 500
Amount deposited successfully!
Current balance: 1500.0
Please select an operation:
Create an account
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Check the balance
Display account information
Exit the program
Enter your choice: 3

Enter account number: 1001
Enter amount to withdraw: 800
Amount withdrawn successfully!
Current balance: 700.0

Please select an operation:
Create an account
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Check the balance
Display account information
Exit the program
Enter your choice: 4
Enter account number: 1001
Current balance: 700
